**Robot Navigation â€“ Path Planning and Occupancy Grid Mapping**

This repository contains my implementation of robot path planning modules across three milestones. The project builds from basic grid-based planning to realistic differential-drive motion planning and finally generates an occupancy grid from real 3D LiDAR sensor data. The final milestone compares the robotâ€™s actual driven path with what a grid-based planner would have suggested in the same environment.

**Overview** 

  ðŸ”¹ Milestone 1: Planning in an Occupancy Grid
      - Implements a standard A* search algorithm to find a feasible path on a binary 2D occupancy grid.
      - Environment: 100Ã—100 grid with randomly placed obstacles.
      - Output: A valid path from start to goal.
  ðŸ”¹ Milestone 2: Including a Robot Model
      - Extends planning to a differential drive robot, accounting for motion constraints and heading.
      - Introduces wheel velocities and motion primitives.
      - Produces a realistic, smooth path reflecting nonholonomic robot movement.
  ðŸ”¹ Milestone 3: Real Sensor Data Integration
      - 3A â€“ Occupancy Grid Generation:
          - Processes 379 LiDAR point cloud scans and odometry data.
          - Filters ground points, transforms each scan into a global frame, and builds a 2D occupancy grid.
      - 3B â€“ Relative Trajectory:
          - Computes the robotâ€™s trajectory relative to its starting pose.
      - 3C â€“ Planned vs Actual Path:
          - Runs A* path planning on the real occupancy grid.
          - Compares the computed path to the robotâ€™s actual driven trajectory.
